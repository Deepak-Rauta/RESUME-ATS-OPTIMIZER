Resume ATS Optimizer 🧠
An intelligent, browser‑based web application that helps job seekers optimize their resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
The tool analyzes your resume and job description side by side, calculates an ATS score, detects missing keywords, and offers actionable recommendations to improve your profile match.

🎯 Project Overview
The Resume ATS Optimizer helps candidates tailor their resumes for specific job postings by performing keyword analysis, skill gap detection, and score visualization.
Using modern web technologies, it ensures your resume aligns with what recruiters and automated systems are searching for.

This is an end‑to‑end ATS testing application, meaning users can paste their resume and job description, receive an evaluation report, and immediately see which parts to improve — all in the browser, with no backend setup required.​

⚙️ Key Features
ATS Score Evaluation
Calculates a match score (0–100) between the resume and job description based on keyword, skill, and phrase frequency.

Keyword Extraction & Highlighting
Automatically extracts job‑specific keywords and visually indicates found vs missing terms in the resume.

Gap Analysis & Recommendations
Uses dynamic text analysis to identify missing competencies, providing actionable improvement suggestions.

Interactive Reports
Displays clean visual metrics — match percentage, total keywords, and keyword density charts for intuitive feedback.

Offline & Secure
Completely runs in‑browser; no backend or external data storage. User data never leaves the local system.

Responsive UI with Dark Mode
Fully responsive design built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with built‑in light/dark mode toggle for better UX.

🚀 How It Works
Paste Resume and Job Description
Copy your plain‑text resume (from Word or PDF) and the job listing you want to apply for.

Click “Analyze Resume”
The algorithm compares both inputs, detects important keywords, and calculates a keyword‑based match score.

View Result Dashboard
See your ATS compatibility percentage, matched vs missing keywords, and detailed recommendations.

Iterate and Improve
Edit your resume to include missing but relevant terms, then re‑test to move toward an optimal score (70+ is ideal).

📊 Example Output

ATS Score: 82/100

Keywords Found: 45 / 60 (75%)

Recommendations:

Add terms like “Cloud Infrastructure”, “CI/CD Pipelines”

Highlight achievements with quantifiable results

Reformat section headers for better parsing

💡 Why It Stands Out
Unlike most resume checkers, this tool:

Runs entirely on the client side (no server dependencies)

Provides instant feedback

Offers a clean and modern UI

Can be extended to integrate LLMs (like Gemini or GPT) for advanced phrasing suggestions.

🧩 Future Enhancements
AI‑powered rewriting with OpenAI / Gemini API

Resume section scoring (Experience, Education, Skills)

PDF/Text resume upload and parsing

Integration with Google Job APIs for real‑time JD extraction

Exportable improvement reports (PDF)
